# Rapid processing of neutral and angry faces within ongoing facial stimulus streams: Is it all about isolated facial features?

In this project, we investigated whether the human brain can extract emotional information from a series of faces flickering at specific frequencies.

This repository contains the pre-processed data and analysis scripts of the following experiments:
* _Pilot 1_: flickering frequency 15 Hz, 9 face identities (all males)
* _Pilot 2_: flickering frequency 15 Hz, 2 face identities (one male, one female)
* _Experiment 1_: flickering frequency 6 Hz, 2 face identities (one male, one female)
* _Experiment 2_: flickering frequency 6 Hz, 2 face identities (one male, one female)
